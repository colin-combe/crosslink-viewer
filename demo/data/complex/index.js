Est1 and TLC1 are sufficient for telomerase activity in vitro, but in vivo all 4 subunits are required. Although telomerase activity can be detected throughout the cell cycle, telomeres are only elongated in late S-phase. Telomerase is known to interact with other complexes, including CDC13 complex (via EST1), Yku70/80 complex (EBI-2464701) (via TLC1) and Sm heteroheptameric complex (via TLC1).  "

            "The ESCRT machinery has been implicated in membrane scission steps, transforming a single, continuous bilayer into two distinct bilayers, either from within the neck of a vesicle budding away from the cytoplasm or from within a membrane tubule, while segregating cargo throughout the process. Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. \r\n\r\nESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission. \r\n\r\nCHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP5 are sometimes regarded as ESCRT-III accessory proteins rather than full complex members, suggesting that multiple variants with different core components and/or associated auxiliary factors may exist within the same cell and be active in different processes."

Structural studies suggest all ESCRT-III subunits are likely to adopt the 4-helix bundle configuration, with a fifth helix connected by a highly flexible linker. Subunits CHMP3 and CHMP6 facilitate anchorage of ESCRT-III to the membrane via the interaction of CHMP3 with phosphatidylinositol phosphate, releasing the conformational inhibition and allowing the complex to assemble into higher-order structures."
